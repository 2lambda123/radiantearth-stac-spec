# STAC ItemCollection Examples

## Overview

This document also contains discussion of the various examples in this folder.

**[sample-minimal.json](examples/sample-minimal.json)** is the most minimal possible compliant ItemCollection entity. Most all data will
include additional fields, as STAC is designed to be a minimal common subset. But it is useful for showing exactly what is
required.

**[sample-full.json](examples/sample-full.json)** is a more realistic example.
