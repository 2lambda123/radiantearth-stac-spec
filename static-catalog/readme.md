# Static Catalog

A static catalog is an implementation of the STAC specification that is simply a set of files on a web server.  The main purpose of the static catalog is to be crawled by various clients.

* The files of the static catalog will be JSON representations of a [STAC catalog feature](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/dev/proposed/spec-draft-sprint-day-2.yaml#/definitions/Feature)
