# STAC EO Extension JSON Spec

This document explains the fields of the STAC Earth Observation (EO) Extension to a STAC `Item`. EO data is considered to be data that represents a snapshot of the earth for a single date and time. It could consist of multiple spectral bands in any part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Examples of EO data include sensors with visible, short-wave and mid-wave IR bands (e.g., the OLI instrument on Landsat-8), long-wave IR bands (e.g. TIRS aboard Landsat-8), as well as SAR instruments (e.g. Sentinel-1).

### `Item:eo:bands`
The bands field of a `Item` is a dictionary where the index identifies a specific band. This is often a band number (e.g., 1, B1, B01), but could be any unique identifier.

| element             | type info                 | name                    | description                                                                                 | 
|----------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| 
| common_name | string (optional) | Common name | The name commonly used to refer to this specific band (see below)
| gsd | float (optional) | Ground sample distance | The average distance between pixel centers as measured in meters on the ground. Defaults to eo:gsd if not provided
| accuracy | float (optional) | Geolocation Accuracy | The expected accuracy of the scene registration, in meters
| center_wavelength | float (optional) | Center wavelength | The center wavelength of the band, in microns
| full_width_half_max | float (optional) | Full width at half maximum | The width of the band, as measured at half the maximum transmission, in microns


##### Common Band Names
The band's common_name is the name that is commonly used to refer to that band's spectral properties. The table below shows the common name based on the average band range for the band numbers of several popular instruments.
