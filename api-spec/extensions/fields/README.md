This document explains the fields of the STAC Electro-Optical (EO) Extension to a STAC Item. EO
data is considered to be data that represents a snapshot of the earth for a single date and time. It
could consist of multiple spectral bands in any part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Examples of EO
data include sensors with visible, short-wave and mid-wave IR bands (e.g., the OLI instrument on
Landsat-8), long-wave IR bands (e.g. TIRS aboard Landsat-8).
